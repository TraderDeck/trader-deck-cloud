0. Account Setup:
 * How many AWS accounts? 
  -- start with one for  now --production
  -- you can have another one for development (testing purposes -for new features) 


1. Networking: 
 
  VPC == 
  * one IGW for internet connectivity
  * one public subnet routing to IGW - this is where ec2 will live
  * one or more private subnets



Considerations: 
* no need for NAT gateway, we will put lambda in public subnet also
  
  * high availability is a next step enahancement
  * enhanced security to be added later
