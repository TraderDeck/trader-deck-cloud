0. Account Setup:
 * How many AWS accounts? 
  -- start with one for  now --production
  -- you can have another one for development (testing purposes -for new features) 


1. Networking: 
 
  VPC == 
  * one IGW for internet connectivity
  * one public subnet routing to IGW - this is where ec2 will live
  * one or more private subnets



Considerations: 
* no need for NAT gateway, we will put lambda in public subnet also
  
  * high availability is a next step enahancement
  * enhanced security to be added later


Where the apps are deployed: 
- React app: deployed to an ec2 in a public subnet (with IGW) in order (or s3+ cloudfront)
- Springboot app: deployed to private subnet that has an Nat gateway for one way communication only (to pull dependencies and have access
to AWS secrets manager). For security reasons, it should never be access from internet
- RDS instance: in a completely private subnet -- no need for internet access + highly secure
